# SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FROM SCRATCH

This repo contains a Python module for building, fitting and testing Support Vector Machines.

The module allows the user to specify Learning Rate & Lambda, as well as number of iterations the Machine should complete whilst fitting.

After building the SVM, I generate random data and compare the accuracy of this SVM model to the SKLearn (Python Machine Learning library) model.
